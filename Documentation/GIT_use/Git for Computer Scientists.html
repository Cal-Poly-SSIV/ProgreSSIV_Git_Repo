<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Quick introduction to <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> internals for people
who are not scared by words like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic
Graph</a>.</p>

<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>

<p>In simplified form, git object storage is "just" a DAG of objects,
with a handful of different types of objects. They are all stored
compressed and identified by an SHA-1 hash (that, incidentally,
<em>isn't</em> the SHA-1 of the contents of the file they represent, but
of their representation in git).</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.1.dot.svg" alt="blob"></p>

<p><code>blob</code>: The simplest object, just a bunch of bytes. This is often
   a file, but can be a symlink or pretty much anything else. The
   object that points to the <code>blob</code> determines the semantics.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.2.dot.svg" alt="tree"></p>

<p><code>tree</code>: Directories are represented by <code>tree</code> object. They
   refer to <code>blob</code>s that have the contents of files (filename,
   access mode, etc is all stored in the <code>tree</code>), and to other
   <code>tree</code>s for subdirectories.</p>

<p>When a node points to another node in the DAG, it <em>depends</em> on the
   other node: it cannot exist without it. Nodes that nothing points
   to can be garbage collected with <code>git gc</code>, or rescued much like
   filesystem inodes with no filenames pointing to them with <code>git
   fsck --lost-found</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.3.dot.svg" alt="commit"></p>

<p><code>commit</code>: A <code>commit</code> refers to a <code>tree</code> that represents the
   state of the files at the time of the commit. It also refers to
   0..<code>n</code> other <code>commit</code>s that are its parents. More than one
   parent means the commit is a merge, no parents means it is an
   initial commit, and interestingly there can be more than one
   initial commit; this usually means two separate projects
   merged. The body of the <code>commit</code> object is the commit message.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.4.dot.svg" alt="refs"></p>

<p><code>refs</code>: References, or heads or branches, are like post-it notes
   slapped on a node in the DAG. Where as the DAG only gets added to
   and existing nodes cannot be mutated, the post-its can be moved
   around freely. They don't get stored in the history, and they
   aren't directly transferred between repositories. They act as sort
   of bookmarks, "I'm working here".</p>

<p><code>git commit</code> adds a node to the DAG and moves the post-it note
   for current branch to this new node.</p>

<p>The <code>HEAD</code> ref is special in that it actually points to another
   ref. It is a pointer to the currently active branch. Normal refs
   are actually in a namespace <code>heads/XXX</code>, but you can often skip
   the <code>heads/</code> part.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.5.dot.svg" alt="remote refs"></p>

<p><code>remote refs</code>: Remote references are post-it notes of a different
   color. The difference to normal <code>refs</code> is the different namespace,
   and the fact that remote refs are essentially controlled by the
   remote server. <code>git fetch</code> updates them.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-storage.6.dot.svg" alt="tag"></p>

<p><code>tag</code>: A <code>tag</code> is both a node in the DAG and a post-it note (of
   yet another color). A <code>tag</code> points to a <code>commit</code>, and includes
   an optional message and a GPG signature.</p>

<p>The post-it is just a fast way to access the tag, and if lost can
   be recovered from just the DAG with <code>git fsck --lost-found</code>.</p>

<p>The nodes in the DAG can be moved from repository to repository, can
be stored in more effective form (packs), and unused nodes can be
garbage collected. But in the end, a <code>git</code> repository is always just
a DAG and post-its.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>So, armed with that knowledge on how <code>git</code> stores the version
history, how do we visualize things like merges, and how does <code>git</code>
differ from tools that try to manage history as linear changes per
branch.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.1.dot.svg" alt="clone"></p>

<p>This is the simplest repository. We have <code>clone</code>d a remote repository
   with one commit in it.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.2.dot.svg" alt="fetch"></p>

<p>Here we have <code>fetch</code>ed the remote and received one new commit
   from the remote, but have not merged it yet.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.3.dot.svg" alt="merge"></p>

<p>The situation after <code>git merge remotes/MYSERVER/master</code>. As the
   merge was a <code>fast forward</code> (that is, we had no new commits in our
   local branch), the only thing that happened was moving our post-it
   note and changing the files in our working directory respectively.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.4.dot.svg" alt="commit"></p>

<p>One local <code>git commit</code> and a <code>git fetch</code> later. We have both a
   new local commit and a new remote commit. Clearly, a merge is
   needed.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.5.dot.svg" alt="merge again"></p>

<p>Results of <code>git merge remotes/MYSERVER/master</code>. Because we had
   new local commits, this wasn't a <code>fast forward</code>, but an actual new
   <code>commit</code> node was created in the DAG. Note how it has two parent
   <code>commit</code>s.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.6.dot.svg" alt="more commits"></p>

<p>Here's what the tree will look after a few commits on both branches
   and another merge. See the "stitching" pattern emerge? The <code>git</code>
   DAG records exactly what the history of actions taken was.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.7.dot.svg" alt="stitching"></p>

<p>The "stitching" pattern is somewhat tedious to read. If you have not
   yet published your branch, or have clearly communicated that others
   should not base their work on it, you have an alternative. You can
   <code>rebase</code> your branch, where instead of merging, your commit is
   replaced by another commit with a different parent, and your branch
   is moved there.</p>

<p>Your old commit(s) will remain in the DAG until garbage collected.
   Ignore them for now, but just know there's a way out if you screwed
   up totally. If you have extra post-its pointing to your old commit,
   they will remain pointing to it, and keep your old commit alive
   indefinitely. That can be fairly confusing, though.</p>

<p>Don't rebase branches that others have created new commits on top
   of. It is possible to recover from that, it's not hard, but the
   extra work needed can be frustrating.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.8.dot.svg" alt="garbage collect"></p>

<p>The situation after garbage collecting (or just ignoring the
   unreachable commit), and creating a new commit on top of your
   <code>rebase</code>d branch.</p>

<p><img src="./Git for Computer Scientists_files/git-history.9.dot.svg" alt="rebase"></p>

<p><code>rebase</code> also knows how to rebase multiple commits with one
   command.</p>

<p>That's the end of our brief intro to <code>git</code> for people who are not
intimidated by computer science. Hope it helped!</p>
